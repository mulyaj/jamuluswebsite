# Getting Started with Jamulus


**Here's how millions of people are using Jamulus to play, sing and teach music with other people in real time, all over the world:**

![Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4561747/79309764-bd387280-7ef2-11ea-9d81-1e81302525e6.png)
_Jamulus works on the client server principle. Everybodyâ€™s audio is sent to a server, mixed and processed there. Afterwards the audio is sent to every client. If a server is made public and registered on a central server, its information will be broadcasted to all clients._

&nbsp;

## System and Hardware Requirements

  - **Windows 10**, **macOS** (**macOS X** El Capitan v10.11 or higher), or **Linux** with a minimum **1.5Hz Processor**. 
  &nbsp;
 - **A wired internet connection** (don't use Wi-Fi, it will cause sound problems). Most broadband <br> connections will be fine[^1].
  &nbsp;
- **Wired headphones - not speakers** to prevent echo or feedback and to minimize delay[^2].


&nbsp;

## Recommended hardware

- **An audio interface with a sample rate of 48Hz (DVD quality).** On Windows it's recommended to choose a device with a native [ASIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Stream_Input/Output) driver.
    &nbsp;
  **and/or**
&nbsp;
- **USB microphone** for singers and acoustic instruments

### Footnotes
[^1]: [Full details here](Network-Requirements){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. If you have 10 Mbit/s down and 1 Mbit/s up, you're unlikely to run into bandwidth-related issues.
[^2]: Bluetooth headphones usually have too much latency. That's one reason why wired headphones are required. Particularity if singing or playing acoustic instruments to make sure you keep in time with others only use headphones (see the [note on this](Getting-Started#having-trouble-cant-keep-in-time) for further information).
